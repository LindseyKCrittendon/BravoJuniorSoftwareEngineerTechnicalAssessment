# Bravo Junior Software Engineer Technical Assessment

## Description
This small scale application utilizes JQuery, JQuery DataTables, Bootstrap, and a deployed mock API to allow the user to view imaginary employees at a  fake company with a clean and simple design.  The user is able to view the employees in an organized table with pagination and a drop-down menu to view ten employees per page at a minimum.  The user can click on arrows corresponding to column name to sort the table in ascending or descending order by first name, last name, facility name, start date, or starting salary.  The user can also use the search bar above the table on the right to search for any information desired.  The table changes automatically with each character typed into the search bar.
